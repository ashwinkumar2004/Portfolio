Open VSCode with portfolio.html and styles.css
but don't open the javascript.txt file directly to yhe the VSCode

For (javascript. txt)..Just open that text file and copy the codes from that javascript.txt 
and in the VSCode..create a javascript file as (script.js)
copy and paste those code inside the (script.js) from the (javascript .txt)
